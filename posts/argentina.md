## Buenos Aires Episode 1

After enduring a never-ending journey across Brazil, we finally arrived in Buenos Aires in the early hours and went straight to bed. We noticed that the heat was significant in the city, but we never imagined how intense it would be the next day.

During the night, we turned on the air conditioning to try to cope with the heat, and it helped, but it came with consequences. In the morning, we all woke up with a slight sore throat that would condition the rest of the trip.

After sleeping for 10 hours, we finally woke up, but it was almost noon, and having breakfast wasn't in our plans. So, we skipped straight to lunch and went for something we were dying to try: the famous Argentinean barbecue.

After the barbecue, we headed out to explore Buenos Aires. We visited the Casa Rosada, the Obelisco, and many other interesting places in the city. We ended the day completely exhausted but satisfied with what we had accomplished. We slept incredibly well that night.

During that same outing, we visited the famous El Ateneo bookstore. I bought a book, which was the script of the play "Los árboles mueren de pie" by Alejandro Casona.
