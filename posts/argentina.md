## Buenos Aires Episode 1

After enduring a never-ending journey across Brazil, we finally arrived in Buenos Aires in the early hours and went straight to bed. We noticed that the heat was significant in the city, but we never imagined how intense it would be the next day.

During the night, we turned on the air conditioning to try to cope with the heat, and it helped, but it came with consequences. In the morning, we all woke up with a slight sore throat that would condition the rest of the trip.
