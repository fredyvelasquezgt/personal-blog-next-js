## Just another day

My name is Fredy Vel√°squez. I'm 50 years old and I live in Guatemala. I wake up in the morning, like any other day. I've always been a lover of sleep, so I stay in bed for a little while longer as I regain all my important faculties. Sunlight is already streaming in through the window, signaling a new day. It's been 20 years since I last slept alone. I got married to the love of my life when I was 30. Even after all this time, she still sleeps and wakes up by my side, but nothing is like it used to be. As I continue to regain my faculties, I reflect on how life has been lately. Fear paralyzes me as I start connecting the dots.

We both become perfect actors. When friends or family are at home, we are the perfect couple; there's no need for us to coordinate that. We both know we have a facade to maintain. But everything changes the moment everyone leaves the house; things go back to normal. We speak only when necessary, we avoid looking each other in the eyes (I can't remember since when), and each of us lives our life the best we can while the other becomes an indispensable hindrance because we can't live together. But the idea of separating destroys us. So, in an act of solidarity with our souls, we lie to ourselves as well. We postpone those uncomfortable conversations because we know they won't lead us anywhere. Each of us cries silently on our side of the bed while the other thinks they are asleep. This is a dynamic where we take turns for convenience, but not for us, not out of love, but out of pity for what once was but is no longer and will never be.



## Beginning

I remember that since I was a child, I've really liked Ricardo Arjona's music. However, it was only recently that I began to realize his genius and the quality of his lyrics. In this post, I will specifically talk about his song "Como Duele," which is part of the album "Quinto Piso."

## Breaking down "Como Duele"

The song begins by mentioning things that are impossible for a simple human to do, but not for a human in love, and this is where the genius begins. The first few seconds of the song let us know that Ricardo has already done everything for his partner, but if that's enough for her, because she doesn't even flinch.

Then, little by little, Arjona begins to narrate his pain to us. It hurts him that the person who is so close to him is also so far away. Something I like about this part is that Arjona's tone of voice becomes softer, which better represents that silent pain we feel in our chest. It hurts Arjona to love his partner, it hurts him to give his life to something that no longer makes any sense. Apparently, this story unfolded over a considerable number of years. Here, I put myself in the author's shoes and try to empathize with him. How would I feel if I realized that I've spent my life loving someone who doesn't love me back? It would surely be terrifying.

Arjona continues narrating the things he has done to regain that love. He tells us about the false hopes he has had regarding the situation getting better, but nothing returned to its place. Something that catches my attention in this part of the song is the phrase "sleeping here in the same bed." Since the bed is generally synonymous with intimacy in a couple, but even there, everything is not in harmony, yet Arjona keeps pretending that everything is fine, that there's a solution, but deep down, he knows there isn't. Surely, someone who has never experienced this wouldn't know how easy it is to let go of such a situation. I think that only a higher force, be it God, life, the universe, or willpower, is capable of freeing us from those demons.

## Conclusion

I want to connect the story from the beginning with the explanation of the song. I know that life is unpredictable, and we are at the mercy of what it wants to send our way, but I hope to never be in a situation like the one at the start. Writing those lines was quite terrifying, and I hope to make the right decisions to prevent that from happening to me, and to never have to experience what is described in "Como duele." Although at my tender age of 21, I have already lived through something similar, albeit on a smaller scale.

I believe the song is a stroke of genius. It perfectly captures the feeling of being in a relationship that has run its course but can't be broken due to certain circumstances, perhaps social or emotional. It's one of Arjona's great themes, his distinct writing style shines through, and the sounds of the song convey the agony experienced in such situations very effectively. Thank you, Ricardo Arjona.
