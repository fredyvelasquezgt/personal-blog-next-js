## Just another day

My name is Fredy Vel√°squez. I'm 50 years old and I live in Guatemala. I wake up in the morning, like any other day. I've always been a lover of sleep, so I stay in bed for a little while longer as I regain all my important faculties. Sunlight is already streaming in through the window, signaling a new day. It's been 20 years since I last slept alone. I got married to the love of my life when I was 30. Even after all this time, she still sleeps and wakes up by my side, but nothing is like it used to be. As I continue to regain my faculties, I reflect on how life has been lately. Fear paralyzes me as I start connecting the dots.



## Beginning

I remember that since I was a child, I've really liked Ricardo Arjona's music. However, it was only recently that I began to realize his genius and the quality of his lyrics. In this post, I will specifically talk about his song "Como Duele," which is part of the album "Quinto Piso."

## Breaking down "Como Duele"

The song begins by mentioning things that are impossible for a simple human to do, but not for a human in love, and this is where the genius begins. The first few seconds of the song let us know that Ricardo has already done everything for his partner, but if that's enough for her, because she doesn't even flinch.

Then, little by little, Arjona begins to narrate his pain to us. It hurts him that the person who is so close to him is also so far away. Something I like about this part is that Arjona's tone of voice becomes softer, which better represents that silent pain we feel in our chest. It hurts Arjona to love his partner, it hurts him to give his life to something that no longer makes any sense. Apparently, this story unfolded over a considerable number of years. Here, I put myself in the author's shoes and try to empathize with him. How would I feel if I realized that I've spent my life loving someone who doesn't love me back? It would surely be terrifying.
