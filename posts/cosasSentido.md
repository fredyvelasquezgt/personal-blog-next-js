## Just another day

My name is Fredy Vel√°squez. I'm 50 years old and I live in Guatemala. I wake up in the morning, like any other day. I've always been a lover of sleep, so I stay in bed for a little while longer as I regain all my important faculties. Sunlight is already streaming in through the window, signaling a new day. It's been 20 years since I last slept alone. I got married to the love of my life when I was 30. Even after all this time, she still sleeps and wakes up by my side, but nothing is like it used to be. As I continue to regain my faculties, I reflect on how life has been lately. Fear paralyzes me as I start connecting the dots.



## Beginning

I remember that since I was a child, I've really liked Ricardo Arjona's music. However, it was only recently that I began to realize his genius and the quality of his lyrics. In this post, I will specifically talk about his song "Como Duele," which is part of the album "Quinto Piso."
