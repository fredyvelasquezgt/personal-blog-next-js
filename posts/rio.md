## Motivation

Lately, I've had an awakening of consciousness like never before. Since the beginning of the year, I set out to understand the world around me. I started studying economics from scratch, but over the months, I realized I needed to delve deeper into the epistemology of the world. I realized I had to study philosophy from scratch, from its origins. That's when I stopped and started studying philosophy again, but this time with a different focus. Now, I wanted to uncover the world. I began with the first philosopher to receive that title: Thales of Miletus. I studied his contemporaries, and I was particularly drawn to the thoughts of Heraclitus. His main teachings revolved around the idea that everything in the world is made of fire and his reflections on constant change. It was in this latter aspect that I paused to study more.
