## The beginning

I first heard "Runaway" a few years ago, but I never really paid much attention to the lyrics; in fact, I found it boring and never managed to grasp the idea it was trying to convey. However, a few months ago, I started becoming more interested in Kanye West's music, and that's when I discovered all the magic behind this man and especially this song, which I find magnificent.

## Kanye West

We can spend hours talking about Kanye West as a person, and even more hours talking about his music, but I just want to say a few things about him. I have analyzed Kanye West and realized he's completely crazy. However, from my point of view, it's the crazy ones who make this world so rich and entertaining, which is why I like him as a person (completely disregarding the episodes where he has proven to be a terrible human being) and I believe the music industry greatly benefits from his presence.

Given his madness, I believe he manages to see things we don't. I think he has experienced complex personal episodes that have led him to view humanity in a completely different way, and it is from this point, in my opinion, that his musical genius begins.

The fact that I don't know Kanye West is evident, but I like to think that he is a very observant and reflective person, and that, combined with a lot of craziness, money, free time, and creativity, results in exceptional works of art like his song "Runaway."

## Runaway

This song perfectly describes Kanye West's narcissistic, egomaniacal, manipulative, dishonest, and sincere behavior towards his romantic partner. He narrates his actions on the stage where he is caught being unfaithful. What strikes me the most about the song is the honesty with which he recounts everything. He tells us in great detail everything that has happened, is happening, and will happen in that relationship he himself has destroyed due to his infidelity. I find it impressive how I identified with the lyrics. The tendency to play the victim even when we know we are directly responsible for the catastrophes that occur. It's a stroke of genius. Many doubts arise in me about this song, the first: Have we all acted like this at some point? Are we truly all so rotten on the inside? Were we born as bad people, or did life make us bad?
